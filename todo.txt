since everything uses indexes, consider def using
arrays instead of lists

consider using checked int operations in leb128 code

best practice for formatting fs, type annotations, colon

other places where an immediate should be an Idx
instead of u32

output s-expressions for testing ?

def and read and write could be in separate assemblies?

review naming of def record fields.  compare to spec.
and conventions, lower case, etc.
