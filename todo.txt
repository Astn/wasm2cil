consider using checked int operations in leb128 code

best practice for formatting fs, type annotations, colon

output s-expressions for testing ?

def and read and write could be in separate assemblies?

review naming of def record fields.  compare to spec.
and conventions, lower case, etc.

tighten the binary wasm stream down to just the
buf and the offset.  have the main api be more
functions and fewer methods
