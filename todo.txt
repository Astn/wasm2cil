globals:
    can be import or internal

how to implement data initialization for an imported
memory

does br need to do stack cleanup?

why doesn't clang mark exports

return value from blocks ?

still some problems in roundtripping binary format that
might be important, not sure

need consistency about whether to pass around
wrapped indexes or just the ints

consider possibility of just using int everywhere
a uint32 is used, because that's just how .NET
does things, with array indexes and such being
int instead of unsigned

in stringify for wat, omit memarg if defaults

consider using checked int operations in leb128 code

best practice for formatting fs, type annotations, colon

def and read and write and wat and cecil could be in separate assemblies?

review naming of def record fields.  compare to spec.
and conventions, lower case, etc.
