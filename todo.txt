why doesn't clang generate any globals?

how to make clang not generate refs to soft fp functions?

how does an imported memory work?  probably
depends on the tool that compiled the wasm.

how to deal with non-mut globals?

consider an F# wrapper around cecil

how to implement data initialization for an imported
memory.  static constructor?

how to deal with select without knowing the type
of the args on the stack?  need to keep track of
them.  which means needing to know how every op
affects the stack.

does br need to do stack cleanup ?

why doesn't clang mark exports ?

return value from blocks ?

still some problems in roundtripping binary format that
might be important, not sure

need consistency about whether to pass around
wrapped indexes or just the ints

consider possibility of just using int everywhere
a uint32 is used, because that's just how .NET
does things, with array indexes and such being
int instead of unsigned

consider using checked int operations in leb128 code

best practice for formatting fs, type annotations, colon

def and read and write and cecil could be in separate assemblies?

review naming of def record fields.  compare to spec.
and conventions, lower case, etc.
